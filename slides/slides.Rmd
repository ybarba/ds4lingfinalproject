# <span style="color: red;">Introduction</span>

- Early studies: neutralization described categorically (López Mórales, 1992). 

  Puerto > [pwél.to] ('port') and verde > [‘bel.de] ('green')
  
- Recent studies: favor gradient approach — lateralization (Luna, 2010). 

  F3: [l¹] = 500–1000 Hz lower

  F4: [l¹] ≈ 120 Hz lower
  
- Linguistic and social contraints on lateralization of the /r/.

---
# <span style="color: red;">Linguistic Constraints</span>

- Position in word (Ramos-Pellicia, 2020):

  Word-final /ɾ/ → more likely to lateralize

  Word-internal /ɾ/ → less likely

- Preceding vowel (Ramos-Pellicia, 2020):

  [a] favors lateralization

  [e] and [o] disfavor it
  
- Word category (Ramos-Pellicia, 2020)

 More likely to show lateralization: infinitives, verbs (in general)
 
 Less likely to show lateralization: nouns, adverbs, and adjectives
---
# <span style="color: red;">Social Constraints</span>

- López Morales (1992): 
   
  All social levels favor it to varying degrees; strongest among lower SES.

- Terrell (1980):

  Women → prefer standard /ɾ/

  Men (especially younger and older) → more lateralization

- López Morales (1983):

  Men in San Juan lateralize more than women

- Holmquist (2003, 2004):

  Younger women → high rates of lateralization
---
# <span style="color: red;">Lateralization in the Puerto Rican Diaspora</span>

- Ma & Herasimchuck (1972):

 NJ Puerto Ricans with less education & rural ties → more lateralization.
 
- Ramos-Pellicia (2004, 2007, 2009):

  Lorain, Ohio:

  Men and women show similar frequencies

  2nd generation lateralizes more than 1st or 3rd

# <span style="color: red;">Research Questions</span>

1. To what extent do PR participants living in NJ utilize lambdacism?

2. To what extent do linguistic factors such as word position, surrounding vowels, and grammatical category influence the occurrence of lambdacism in Puerto Rican Spanish?

3. Do the social characteristics of Puerto Ricans in New Jersey, such as gender, and educational background constrain their use of the aforementioned sociophonological features?

# <span style="color: red;">About the effect of internal and external linguistic factors on F3 and F4 values </span>

- To assess the influence of internal linguistic and external social factors on F3 and F4 values, a series of mixed-effects models were built with random intercepts for participants and lexical items. This approach accounts for repeated measures and individual variability while capturing the hierarchical structure of the data. 
- It also allows for the simultaneous analysis of linguistic factors (e.g., word category, vowel context, word position) and social variables (e.g., gender, educational background) within a unified framework.
---
# <span style="color: red;"> Internal and external linguistic factors on F3 </span>

- Null model: Included random intercepts for participant and word
 
  Estimated overall mean F3: 2421.81 Hz (SE = 64.14, p < 0.001)
  
- Model 1: Added position inside the word (internal vs. final) as fixed effect

  Model fit improved (p = 0.004)
  
  Internal position → higher F3 than final
  Estimate = 128.19, SE = 41.53, p = 0.005
  
- Model 2:Added word category (noun, verb, adjective, preposition)
  
  No significant effects (p > 0.24)
  Did not improve model fit → excluded from further models
  
- Model 3:  Added preceding vowel alongside position
  
  Improved model over Model 1 (p = 0.005)
  
  /o/: significantly lower F3 (Estimate = –106.79, p = 0.029)
  /e/: marginal effect (Estimate = 94.12, p = 0.085)

---

- Model 4: Gender added with position and preceding vowel
 
  Improved fit over Model 3 (p = 0.021)
  
  Women → higher F3 than men (Estimate = 246.57, p = 0.036)

  Effects of vowel and position remained consistent
  
- Model 5:  Model 5 – Interaction: Gender × Preceding Vowel

  Best overall model (p < 0.001)

  Significant interaction effects:

  /e/ × Gender: Estimate = 251.77, p < 0.001

  /o/ × Gender: Estimate = 126.58, p = 0.043

  Vowel effects differ by gender

# <span style="color: red;"> Internal and external linguistic factors on F4 </span>

- Null model:

  Random intercepts: participant, word

  Fixed intercept: F4 = 3610.31 Hz

  Residual variance: 109,921 (SD = 331.54)

- Model 1: Added position inside the word

  Internal position → +150.62 Hz (p = 0.0013)

  Significantly improved model fit

- Model 2: Added word category to position

  Preposition: significant decrease in F4 (–315.20 Hz, p = 0.0092)

  Caution: only 1 token

  Other categories (noun, verb): no significant effect
---
- Model 3: Added preceding vowel alongside position

  Vowel /e/: significantly raised F4 (+126.90 Hz, p = 0.040)

  Vowel /o/: no significant effect

  Improved model over null and Model 1
  
- Model 4: Added gender to position + vowel model

  Women → higher F4 (+439.10 Hz, p = 0.0012)

  Model significantly better than previous (p < 0.001)
  
- Model 5: Tested Gender × Preceding Vowel interaction

  /o/ × Gender: significant (p = 0.004)

  /e/ × Gender: marginal (p = 0.074)

  Main effect of gender remained significant (p = 0.009)

  Model 5 = Best fit overall (p = 0.013)

# <span style="color: red;"> Discussion </span>

- Word-internal positions yield higher F3 and F4 valuess.

  Ramos-Pellicia (2020) similarly observed that word-final positions favor   
  lateralization.
  
- Preceding vowel /o/ lowered F3 significantly, while /e/ marginally raised F3 and   F4, but these effects interacted with gender.

  Ramos-Pellicia (2020) found that [a] favors lateralization, whereas [e] and [o] disfavor it.
  
- Women had significantly higher F3 and F4 values, indicating less lateralization, which aligns with Terrell (1980) and López Morales (1983), who said women favor standard variants.

- Lower F3/F4 values in speakers with lower education, and higher formants in those with more education. This matches Poplack’s (1979) Philadelphia study and Ma & Herasimchuk (1972) in New Jersey.
